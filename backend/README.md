# Tripleten PDV API

This application was created for studying purposes.

We're going to develop an api RESTFUL with Node.js to provide to our PDV application, all the needed resources.

The main packages used in this project includes: Express, Prettier, Eslint, Husky, Lint-staged, commitlint and Mongoose.

This project is shared between different cohorts from Practicum's course.
So, each of them will have a dedicated and separate branch.
