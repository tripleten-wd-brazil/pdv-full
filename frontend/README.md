# Practicum PDV

This application was created for studying purposes.

We're going to use React library to build a point of sale (POS, in portuguese PDV) software. The project was scaffolded using Vite.

The design used is well described in this  [figma file.](https://www.figma.com/file/00zods6GB5lP4o48HwdoP9/PDV?node-id=0:1&t=7OJye74EtojzoyYg-0)

Thanks Thiago Castro for your hard working making this designs available for free. You can check more of his work  [right here.](https://thiagocastroux.com/)
